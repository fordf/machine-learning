## Analyzing a Dataset

[The dataset in question](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing)

#### What's in the data

It concerns housing values in the suburbs of Boston, back in 1978.
For each tract of land, there is data on:

* Crime rate
* Proportion of non-retail business (by acreage)
* Whether tract bounds the Charles River
* Nitric Oxide Concetrations
* Age of housing
* Distance to employment centers
* Pupil-teacher ratio
* Proportion of black citizens
* Median value of occupied homes

and more!

I aimed to visualize relationships in the data and find where correlations might exist.

## Working With Imperfect Data

[The dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/School-Demographics-and-Accountability-Snapshot-20/ihfw-zy9j)

Annual school accounts of NYC public school student populations served by grade, special programs, ethnicity, gender and Title I funded programs. It has 10000 rows and 38 columns, many of which I don't know the meaning of. For each school, there is data for:

* Total enrollment
* Enrollment for each grade
* Number/Percentage for Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White racial groups.
* Number/Percentage for english language learners
* Number/Percentage for male/female

and more!
