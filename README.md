## Analyzing a Dataset

[The dataset in question](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing)

#### What's in the data

It concerns housing values in the suburbs of Boston, back in 1978.
For each tract of land, there is data on:

* Crime rate
* Proportion of non-retail business (by acreage)
* Whether tract bounds the Charles River
* Nitric Oxide Concetrations
* Age of housing
* Distance to employment centers
* Pupil-teacher ratio
* Proportion of black citizens
* Median value of occupied homes

and more!

I aimed to visualize relationships in the data and find where correlations might exist.
